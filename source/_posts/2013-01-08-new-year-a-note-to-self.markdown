After being away from the project for the holidays I started again to work on it
last week and there is something I have to remember as a note to self: "When taking
over a project, finish the new feature first and then improve the project."

And by improving the project I mean this time I am right now where I wanted the
source code to be well organized, a better project structure, to refactor and many
things that will benefit the health of the project and also any future developer's
health.

So, next time, finish the work you are supposed to do, and then contribute.

That was just a reminder to myself.
