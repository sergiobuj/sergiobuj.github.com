The Purdue University (IN, US) is working closely with EAFIT University (ANT, CO) on a project to set up a supercomputer on EAFIT and be able to support some of the current scientific research in Colombia by providing the computational capabilities needed to process large sets of data and the creation and visualization of simulations.

From October 5th 2011 until December 13th 2011, West Lafayette will be my home. Where I will be learning about the internals of the [Hubzero platform](http://www.hubzero.org), and how to replicate the success it's had.

More about the trip and stuff.
