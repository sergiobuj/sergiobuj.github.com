Beginning this week I will be working for a period of 3 months with the people of the Research in Spatial Economics group ([RiSE](http://www.rise-group.org/)) at Universidad EAFIT. They developed a library of spatially constrained clustering algorithms named [ClusterPy](http://www.rise-group.org/risem/clusterpy/index.html). I will be helping them in making some optimizations and basically, in changing a few things to make the library able to run on clusters and reduce running times.

At the moment I will start looking at the following algorithms:

- [max-p](http://www.rise-group.org/risem/clusterpy/clusterpy0_9_9/endogenous.html#maxp-description)
- [AZP SA](http://www.rise-group.org/risem/clusterpy/clusterpy0_9_9/exogenous.html#azpsa-description)
- [AZPtabu](http://www.rise-group.org/risem/clusterpy/clusterpy0_9_9/exogenous.html#azpt-description)

This work has a huge impact since the library is currently being used by many people and the algorithms have already started many discussions in the topic. I hope I can make a good contribution to the project.
