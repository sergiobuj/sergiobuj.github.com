In this post I would like to thank [Hock](https://github.com/nhocki) ([nhocki](https://twitter.com/nhocki) on twitter) for a great gift. A gift that will teach me a lot about writing and that will, with no doubt, make a good writer out of me (hopefuly).
The gift was a book from William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White and it is called [The Elements of Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326839018&sr=8-1).

The only thing left to say is that I intend to write each post better than the previous (in terms of style, grammar, sense, vocabulary and structure) and that any comments about it are very welcome.
