I want to learn many things and some of those are libraries and tools to work
with data and visualize it. I will use <a href='http://ipython.org/notebook.html' target='_blank'>IPyhton notebooks</a>.

##### Cloning to learn matplotlib
<a href='http://matplotlib.org' target='_blank'>Matplotlib</a> is the preferred python plotting library for
2D figures and is a very strong open source project. I believe the best way to
learn something is by doing. In order to learn matplotlib, without actually
having to use it for work or a publication, I will try to reproduce different
charts and graphs I see.

   1. [Exercise 1] I found a comparison graph about the most lucrative majors and this is how my clone looks like. <a href='http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7076810/learning_cloning_matplotlib_1.ipynb' target='_blank'>link</a>.
   2. [Exercise 2] I somehow failed to clone a graph that shows some data about Software Sales from Apple. The topic comes from the news since Apple made available the latest OS X for free. <a href='http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7076810/learning_cloning_matplotlib_2.ipynb' target='_blank'>Attempt here</a>
