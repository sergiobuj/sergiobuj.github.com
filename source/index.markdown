I want to learn many things and some of those are libraries and tools to work
with data and visualize it. I will use [IPyhton notebooks]().

##### Cloning to learn matplotlib
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is the preferred python plotting library for
2D figures and is a very strong open source project. I believe the best way to
learn something is by doing. In order to learn matplotlib, without actually
having to use for work or a publication, I will try to reproduce different
charts and graphs I see.
